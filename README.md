# Algorithms2-Project

Mingwei, Eligijus, Brian and Pavel - 2nd year project in Algo and Data Structures module


### Main Program
 DO NOT COMPILE/RUN ON ECLIPSE CONSOLE
 Eclipse compiles \r (carriage return) as \n (new line) resulting in an error
 
 Recommended IDE: IntelliJ
 
 
 For demonstrators: You need to put the input files in the same folder as MainProgram.java. In case you are still having problems with the input files you should open 
 your run configuration and check that the working directory is specified correctly.

 
 ### Roles and Weekly Meetings
 Function1 - Pavel
 
 Function2 - Mingwei
 
 Function3 - Brian
 
 CLI - Eligijus

Weekly Meeting 1 - Thursday 8th April

In our first meeting we discussed the project and used a random number generator to assign roles. After this we then discussed different algorithms we could use for parts 1-3 and what kind of UI we will implement. At the end of the meeting we came to the following conclusions:
Each team member got assigned the roles in the table at the top of the document
We decided to go with a command line interface
We will have weekly meetings on Thursdays 2-3pm and communicate on discord between meetings

Weekly Meeting 2 - Thursday 15th April

We discussed our progress and made sure everyone is on the same page. Brian and Mingwei have more or less finished their functionality and Eligijus integrated these parts into the initial CLI interface

Weekly Meeting 3 - Thursday 22nd April

Due to workload from other modules, we decided not to meet at that time. The only outstanding functionality was Pavelâ€™s, other functions were integrated into CLI and tested. 

Weekly Meeting 4 - Wednesday 28th April

Pavel has finished Functionality 1 and Eligijus integrated it into CLI as well as added error handling. Brian integrated a more efficient version of MergeSort into his part. We finished up the documentation part and recorded the video demo.
